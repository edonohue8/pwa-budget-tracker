# Unit 18 PWA Homework: Online/Offline Budget Trackers

## Description

My assignment was to add functionality to an existing Budget Tracker app to allow for offline access.  After the user adds expenses to his/her budget without an internet connection, the entered transactions should populate unto the budget tracker once the user is back online.

For this app, I utilized MongoDB Atlas and deployed on Heroku.
